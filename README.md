# 📘 DSA Tracker – Full Stack Application

A full-stack DSA practice tracker that uses **spaced repetition**, **consistency analytics**, and **pattern-based insights** to help users revise Data Structures & Algorithms efficiently.

Built with **FastAPI (backend)** and **Streamlit (frontend)** and deployed on cloud.

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Spaced repetition scheduling (Day 1, 2, 4, 6 / daily for hard)
- ✅ Track solved, missed, and weak questions
- 🔥 Consistency score & streak tracking
- 📊 Analytics dashboard with charts
- 🧠 Pattern-based analysis (Array, DP, Graph, etc.)
- 🌐 Fully deployed (Backend + Frontend)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User adds a DSA question with difficulty & patterns
2. App generates spaced repetition schedule
3. User marks questions as done
4. System tracks:
   - Missed days
   - Daily solves
   - Consistency streak
5. Analytics dashboard updates in real time

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Backend API**: (Render)
- **Frontend UI**: (Streamlit Cloud)

> Note: Backend may take ~30 seconds to wake up on first request (free tier).
